# JDA_Learning_Python
This repository documents my personal journey of learning Python programming. It contains a collection of practice scripts, exercises, and mini-projects that I have completed while exploring the fundamentals of Python. See the Read-Me file for more information. 

The goal of sharing these files is twofold:
To track my own progress and growth as I continue to build programming skills.
To provide a resource for others who are also learning Python â€” whether youâ€™re just starting out or looking for examples to practice with.

Inside this repository youâ€™ll find code that covers:
Core Python concepts (variables, loops, functions, conditionals)
Small utilities and problem-solving exercises
Beginner projects such as calculators, games, and text-based programs
Well-commented code to make it easier to follow and learn from

ðŸš€ Feel free to explore, practice with the examples, or even suggest improvements.
My hope is that this repo can serve as both a learning log for myself and a helpful guide for fellow Python beginners.
